## The Main Idea

The idea I had was that you can drag scroll sideways and it goes though a history of my git projects. You start at a info booth where you can acsses my cv and other info and then to the rigth it is a history of pass projects and then to the left it breaks out of the museum and gose outside and shows the projects that I am currently working on. The frames have an image showing the project, hopefully I can make it a 3d image so as you scroll across the screen the pespective of the image changes.
